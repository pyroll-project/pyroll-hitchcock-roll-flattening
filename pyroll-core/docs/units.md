Think of a rolling process as of a sequence of roll passes and intermediate times, called transports. Both are subsumed
under the term *unit*. The `Unit` class is the base class representing this concept.

It defines three attributes:

| Attribute     | Description                                                               |
|---------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `label`       | A label string for human identification, used in log messages and output. |
| `in_profile`  | The profile that represents the incoming workpiece state into the unit.   |
| `out_profile` | The profile that represents the outgoing workpiece state out of the unit. |

Currently, two derived classes exist in the core library: [`RollPass`](units.md#roll-passes)
and [`Transport`](units.md#transports).

The unit class defines an abstract method `solve(in_profile: Profile)`, which triggers the solution procedure an accepts
a profile object that has to be treated as the incoming profile. This object in copied and modified and made available
in the `in_profile` attribute by the implementations of this method.

Also, it maintains hooks that should be applicable to all types of units.

## Roll Passes

The roll pass is the most important unit, since deformation is happening here. It is represented by the `RollPass`
class.

The constructor takes the basic attributes of the roll pass and additional keyword arguments.

| Argument      | Description                                                                   |
|---------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `groove`      | The groove object defining the shape of the roll gap, see [here](grooves.md). |
| `roll_radius` | The mean roll radius of both rolls, measured at their flat surface.           |
| `velocity`    | Workpiece velocity in the roll pass.                                          |
| `gap`         | The gap between the flat surfaces of the rolls.                               |
| `label`       | A label string for human identification, used in log messages and output.     |

The class provides several basics geometric attributes calculated from this information:

| Attribute              | Description                                            |
|------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| `height`               | Maximum heigth of the roll gap.                        |
| `tip_width`            | $b_\mathrm{ks}$                                        |
| `usable_cross_section` | Cross-section of the roll gap bounded by usable width. |
| `tip_cross_section`    | Cross-section of the roll gap bounded by tip width.    |
| `minimal_roll_radius`  | Roll radius minus groove depth.                        |

### Hooks

> To read about the basics of hooks and plugins, see [here](plugins.md).

On roll passes, several basic hooks are specified and implemented. You can provide your own implementations of them and
also specify new ones.

#### `in_profile_rotation`

The angle in degree by which the incoming profile is rotated at feeding into the roll pass. Currently only integers are
valid values. Per default common rotations are implemented for the available groove types. Typically you will use
the `applies_to_in_grooves` and `applies_to_in_grooves` decorators from `pyroll.utils` to provide new implementations.
The code block below shows an example implementation of this hook, the explicit `specname` is used to avoid naming
conflicts when providing more than one implementation in one file.

```python
@RollPass.hookimpl(specname="in_profile_rotation")
@applies_to_in_grooves("diamond")
@applies_to_out_grooves("diamond")
def diamonds(roll_pass):
    return 90
```

#### `roll_force`

The roll force occurring in this pass. The default implementation calculates the roll force according to the Hensel
model[^HenselPoluchin1990]. This is an empirical model using an master curve for an inverse rolling efficiency as shown
in the figure below.

#### `roll_torque`

The roll torque occurring at one roll in this pass. The default implementation calculates the roll torque according to
the Hensel model[^HenselPoluchin1990].
