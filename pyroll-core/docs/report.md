# HTML Report Generation

PyRoll includes a class capable of generating an HTML page presenting the simulation results, which can be archived and
printed. The report can be generated by use of the CLI through the [`report`](cli.md#report) command.

The report includes per default key properties of all units, plots of incoming and outgoing profiles in each roll pass,
as well as some plots of key values along the whole sequence.
The contents of the report can be modified using hooks.
